# CA400 template repo

This is an archived version of my final year project (CA400) in DCU.

Allert is an application that allows users to scan product ingredient lists and flags any products that
may cause that user a specific allergic reaction. The app is cross-platform and is hosted on AWS with
serverless infrastructure. The main back-end component of the application is an OCR function which
utilises Tesseract and OpenCV.
